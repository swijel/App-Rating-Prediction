# App-Rating-Prediction
Using Data Analysis/Visualization and ML to predict the rating an App would get on the Google Play Store.

The goal of this project is to predict the rating of an app on the Google Play Store based on its features such as app name, category, size, number of installations, content rating, etc. This can help developers understand the factors that influence app ratings and predict potential ratings for their apps.

# Tools & Libraries
Python: The main programming language for this project.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for interactive development and analysis.
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

# Dataset
A dataset of Google Play apps, which typically includes columns like:

App Name: The name of the app.
Category: The type of app (e.g., Games, Social, Productivity).
Rating: The rating of the app (target variable).
Reviews: The number of reviews for the app.
Size: The size of the app in MB.
Installs: The number of installs (e.g., 1,000,000+).
Type: Whether the app is free or paid.
Price: The price of the app (if paid).
Content Rating: The content rating (e.g., Everyone, Teen, Mature).
Genres: Subcategory of the app.
Last Updated: The date the app was last updated.
Current Version: The version of the app.
Android Version: The minimum required Android version.


## This project involves loading and cleaning the Google Play Store app dataset, exploring it with visualizations, engineering relevant features, and applying machine learning models to predict app ratings. By evaluating different models and tuning them, you will be able to determine the best-performing model for your prediction task.
